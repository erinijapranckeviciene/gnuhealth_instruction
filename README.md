## Setup Instructions and clarification of confusing steps 
To set up and configure the open source Laboratory Information System using GNU Health one can follow the official [technical guide](https://docs.gnuhealth.org/his/techguide/installation/). 

For unexperienced user there might be several installation and configuration steps in the official guide that may be challenging and one can spend a lot of time figuring out how to resolve issues (happenned to me). Therefore, I wrote a short complement walk through the installation following a _Vanilla_ instalation and set up of GNU Health on a fresh Ubuntu 22.04.

There are two components of GNU Health - a server and a client. 

## The GNU Health server component
The GNU Health server component comprises a database (Postgresql), a Tryton enterprise software package and a GNU Health wrapper. There must be a designated user gnuhealth under whose account the GNU health service will be running. 

### Step 1. Add a user _gnuhealth_
The GNU Health requires a specialized user under whose account the system will run. By default this user has name gnuhealth. To add a user to the system you have to have sudo rights. 
```
$sudo adduser gnuhealth
```

### Step 2. Database setup
The GNU Health uses PostgreSQL database, [docummentation link](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/index.html).
