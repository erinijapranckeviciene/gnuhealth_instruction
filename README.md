## Setup Instructions and clarification of confusing steps 
To set up and configure the open source Laboratory Information System using GNU Health one can follow the official [technical guide](https://docs.gnuhealth.org/his/techguide/installation/). 

For unexperienced user there might be several installation and configuration steps in the official guide that may be challenging and one can spend a lot of time figuring out how to resolve issues (happenned to me). Therefore I wrote a walk through the installation and set up on Ubuntu 22.04 where appropriate giving credits to the enthusiats in various forums for sharing their knowledge and experience.
